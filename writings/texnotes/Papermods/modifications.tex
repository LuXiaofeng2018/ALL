\section{Modifications}
Here I go through my corrections to Chris's paper using the section titles as subsections

\subsection{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
\item I think we should use conservation laws, or equations in conservative law form instead of hyperbolic equations in reference to the techniques we use.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``is used to solve the stiff source term, which contain the ...'' should be `contains'
\item ``with the water depth and a new quantity as conservative variables'', should it be conserved instead of conservative?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solving the Serre Equations Written in Conservation Law Form}
\subsubsection{Approximate Riemann Solver}
Here the change is rather significant, I have changed the way we handle $u$ assuming it is continuous. So basically we can use what is already written below equation (24) for all the variables except $u$. Then in addition we have to add how we handle $u$. \\
For the First and Second order method the derivative of $u$ at the edge is:

\[ \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)_{j + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{u_{j+1} - u_{j}}{\Delta x}\]

For the third order method the derivative of $u$ at the edge is:

\[ \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)_{j + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{-u_{j + 2} + 27u_{j+1} - 27u_{j} + u_{j-1}}{24 \Delta x}\]\\ \\

Now for the $u$ reconstruction.
For the first and second order method we use
\[u_{j + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{u_{j+1} + u_j}{2}\]
for the third order method
\[u_{j + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{-3u_{j+2} + 27u_{j+1} + 27u_j - 3u_{j-1}}{48}\]

\subsection{Numerical Simulations}
\subsubsection{Steady Flow over a Bump}
Because of this change in the handling of $u$ I think it is only appropriate to change the source term's gradient of $u$ as well. So now in $S_{ci}$ instead of
\[\frac{u^-_{j + 1/2} - u^+_{j-1/2}}{\Delta x}\]
it should be replaced with 
\[\frac{u_{j + 1} - u_{j-1}}{2 \Delta x}\]

This change has improved our results for conservation of the energy, also I think it is probably more informative to a reader to give both $\mathcal{H}(0)$ and $\mathcal{H}(50s)$ then report the relative error.
From my experiments I have:

\[\mathcal{H}(0) = 2250.56717819\]
\[\mathcal{H}(50s) = 2250.56244098\]

So we have

\[\frac{\left|\mathcal{H}(0) - \mathcal{H}(50s)\right|}{\left|\mathcal{H}(0) \right|} = 2.1048960662740493 \times 10^{-6}\]
