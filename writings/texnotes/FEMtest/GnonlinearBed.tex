\section{Elliptic Equation}
The elliptic equation is
\[G = uh - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{h^3}{3}u_x\right)\]

with bed terms it is

\[G = uh + u\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) + h b_x^2\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{h^3}{3}u_x\right)\]


\section{Finite Element}


\[G = uh + u\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) + h b_x^2\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{h^3}{3}u_x\right)\]

To do so we begin by first multiplying by an arbitrary test function $v$ so that


\[Gv = uhv + uv\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) + h b_x^2\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{h^3}{3}u_x\right)v\]

and then we integrate over the entire domain to get 

\[\int_\Omega Gv \; dx = \int_\Omega uhv \; dx + \int_\Omega u\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) + h b_x^2\right)v \; dx - \int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{h^3}{3}u_x\right)v \; dx\]

for all $v$

We then make use of integration by parts, with Dirchlet boundaries to get

\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega uhv dx + \int_\Omega\frac{h^3}{3}u_{x}v_xdx + \int_\Omega u\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) + h b_x^2\right)v \; dx\]

\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega uhv dx + \int_\Omega\frac{h^3}{3}u_{x}v_xdx + \int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^2}{2}b_x\right) uv \; dx + \int_\Omega u h b_x^2 v \; dx\]

\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega uhv dx + \int_\Omega\frac{h^3}{3}u_{x}v_xdx - \int_\Omega  \frac{h^2}{2}b_x \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(uv\right)  \; dx + \int_\Omega u h b_x^2 v \; dx\]

\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega uhv dx + \int_\Omega\frac{h^3}{3}u_{x}v_xdx - \int_\Omega  \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u_x v \; dx - \int_\Omega  \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u v_x \; dx + \int_\Omega u h b_x^2 v \; dx\]

So importantly we just require that $b_x$ is well behaved, and in particular it must be continuous


\begin{multline*}
\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} Gv dx = \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}}  uhv dx + \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} \frac{h^3}{3}u_{x}v_{x}dx \\- \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u_x vdx -\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}}  \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u v_x dx + \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} u h b_x^2 vdx 
\end{multline*}

\section{P1 FEM}
We are going to cordinate tranform from x space the interval $[x_{j-1/2},x_{j+1/2} ,x_{j+3/2}]$ to the $\xi$ space interval $[-1,0,1]$. To accomplish this we have the following relation

$$x = \xi\Delta x + x_{j+1/2}$$

Taking the derivatives we see


$dx = d\xi\Delta x$ , $\frac{dx}{d\xi} = \Delta x$ , $\frac{d\xi}{dx} = \frac{1}{\Delta x}$ . \\ \\ We can describe the basis functions in the $\xi$ space

\begin{equation}
\phi_{j+1/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
1 + \xi & \xi < 0 \\
1 - \xi & \xi > 0\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\phi_{j-1/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
-\xi & \xi < 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\phi_{j+3/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
\xi & \xi > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

While the descriptions for $w$'s is
\begin{equation}
w^+_{j+1/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
1-\xi & \xi > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w^-_{j+1/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
1+\xi & \xi < 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w^+_{j-1/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
-\xi & \xi < 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w^-_{j+3/2} = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c c}
\xi & \xi > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation}

We now replace our functions by our approximations to them

\[G \approx G' = \sum_{j}G_{j+1/2}w_{j+1/2}\]
\[u \approx u' = \sum_{j}u_{j+1/2}\phi_{j+1/2}\]
\[b \approx b' = \sum_{j}b_{j+1/2}\phi_{j+1/2}\]
\[h \approx h' = \sum_{j}h_{j+1/2}w_{j+1/2}\]

For all $\phi_{j+1/2}$. For this analysis we choose a particular basis function $\phi_{j+1/2}$ and we look at all the integrals. Now we have already done the integrals with no bed term, so we focus on the bed terms now

which are

\[
- \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u_x vdx -\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}}  \frac{h^2}{2}b_x u v_x dx + \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} u h b_x^2 vdx 
\]

Lets begin with the rightmost, first we change variable from $x$ to $\xi$

\[\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} \frac{(h'(x))^2}{2}b_x(x) u_x(x) \phi_{j+1/2}(x)dx = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{(h'(\xi))^2}{2}b'(\xi)_{\xi}\frac{d\xi}{dx}  u'(\xi)_{\xi} \frac{d\xi}{dx} \phi_{j+1/2}(\xi)  \frac{dx}{d\xi} dx\]

\[= \frac{1}{\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{(h')^2}{2}b'_{\xi} u'_{\xi} \phi_{j+1/2} d\xi\]

Now we expand to the P1 approximations to include only where $\phi_{j+1/2}$ is non zero, also we use $'$ to denote derivatives

which is

\[h' = h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}   \]

\[b_{\xi}' = b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}   \]

\[u_{\xi}' = u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} + u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}   \]

\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \left[h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right]^2 \times \\
\left[b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} \right] \times \\
\left[u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} + u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} \right] \phi_{j+1/2} d\xi
\end{multline}

Note that we can square $a + b + c +d$ simply because $ac = ad = bc = bd = 0$ so we get that
\[[a +b + c + d]^2 = (a+b)^2 + (c+d)^2\] therefore

\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \bigg[\left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + \left(h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}\right)^2  \\+ \left(h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2} + \left(h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)^2\bigg] \times \\
\bigg[b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} \\+ b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} \\+  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +   b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}   \bigg] \phi_{j+1/2} d\xi
\end{multline}

\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \bigg[\left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + \left(h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}\right)^2  \\+ \left(h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^+_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+3/2} + \left(h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)^2\bigg] \times \\

\end{multline}

but $\phi'_{j+3/2}  \phi'_{j-1/2}$ is zero everywhere


\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \bigg[\left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + \left(h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}\right)^2  \\+ \left(h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}\right)^2 + 2h^+_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^+_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+3/2} + \left(h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)^2\bigg] \times \\

\end{multline}

\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \\
 \bigg(\bigg[ h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg] \times \\\big[b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}  + b'_{j+1/2} u'_{j-1/2}\phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} \\+ b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}  \big]  \\ +  \bigg[h^+_{j+1/2}h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}w^+_{j+1/2}+ 2h^+_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^+_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+3/2} + h^-_{j+3/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}w^-_{j+3/2}\bigg] \times\\\big[ b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} \\ +   b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} +   b'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2}\phi'_{j+3/2}  \phi'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+3/2}   \big]  \bigg) \phi_{j+1/2} d\xi
\end{multline}

breaking this down we have two integrals over seperate domains in particular the first term is only non zero on $\xi \in [-1,0]$ and the second is only non-zero on $\xi \in [0,1]$

For the first term when $\xi \in [-1,0]$ then
\[\phi'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} = \phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2}  =1\]
and
\[\phi'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} = -1\]

So we can simplify it to be

\begin{multline*}
\bigg[ h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg] \times \\\big[b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2} - b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2}  - b'_{j+1/2} u'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2}  \big]
\end{multline*}

Thus

\begin{multline*}
=\bigg[b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2} h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \\+ b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg] \\- \bigg[ b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \\ + b'_{j-1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg] \\- \bigg[ b'_{j+1/2} u'_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2b'_{j+1/2} u'_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \\+ b'_{j+1/2} u'_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg]\\+ \bigg[ b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2}w^+_{j-1/2}  + 2b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \\+ b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+1/2}\bigg]
\end{multline*}

for the second term when $\xi \in [0,0]$ then
\[\phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} = \phi'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}  =1\]
and
\[\phi'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+3/2} = -1\]

\begin{multline*}
\bigg[h^+_{j+1/2}h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2}w^+_{j+1/2}+ 2h^+_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^+_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+3/2} + h^-_{j+3/2}h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}w^-_{j+3/2}\bigg] \times\\\big[ b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+1/2}  -   b'_{j+1/2}u'_{j+3/2} -  b'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2} u'_{j+3/2}   \big]

\begin{multline*}

\end{multline*}

Only the basis functions are indeed functions so we just compute them

Working our way across 
first we change variable from $x$ to $\xi$

\[\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+3/2}} \frac{(h'(x))^2}{2}b_x(x) u(x) {\phi_{j+1/2}}_x(x)dx = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{(h'(\xi))^2}{2}b'(\xi)_{\xi}\frac{d\xi}{dx}  u'(\xi) {\phi_{j+1/2}}_{\xi}(\xi)\frac{d\xi}{dx}  \frac{dx}{d\xi} dx\]

\[ =\frac{1}{2 \Delta x} \int_{-1}^{1} (h'(\xi))^2b'(\xi)_{\xi} u'(\xi) {\phi_{j+1/2}}_{\xi}(\xi)dx\]

Replacing with our approximations, switching $'$to mean derivatives then

\[h' = h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}   \]

\[b_{\xi}' = b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}   \]

\[u' = u_{j-1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} +  u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} + u_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+3/2}   \]

\begin{multline*}
=\frac{1}{2 \Delta x} \int_{-1}^{1} \left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} + h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)^2\\ \times \left(b'_{j-1/2} \phi'_{j-1/2} +  b'_{j+1/2} \phi'_{j+1/2} +  b'_{j+3/2} \phi'_{j+3/2}\right)\\ \times\left(u_{j-1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} +  u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} + u_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+3/2} \right) \phi'_{j+1/2} d\xi
\end{multline*}

This is very similar to before but derivatives on u and v switched So we have

\begin{multline}
= \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\int_{-1}^{1} \\

\end{multline}

where again we have that the two terms here are only nonzero on each half of our domain, so we can use the gradient properties again and we have

using when $w$'s are zero
\begin{multline*}

\frac{1}{\Delta x} \bigg\lbrace \int_{-1}^{0} \bigg(\left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \right)\left(u_{j-1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} +  u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} \right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} - 2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2}+ b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2}  - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi
\\+ \int_{0}^{1} \bigg(\left( h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)\left(u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} + u_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+3/2} \right) \bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} -  2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2} - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi \bigg\rbrace
\end{multline*}

The first term is 

\begin{multline*}
\int_{-1}^{0} \bigg(\left(h^+_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + h^-_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \right)\left(u_{j-1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} +  u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} \right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} - 2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2}+ b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2}  - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi
\end{multline*}

\begin{multline*}
=\int_{-1}^{0} \bigg(\left(u_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + u_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} \phi_{j-1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \right) \\+ \left(u_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} w^+_{j-1/2} + u_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} w^-_{j+1/2} \right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} - 2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2}+ b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2}  - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi
\end{multline*}


\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^+_{j-1/2}\phi_{j-1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (-\xi)(-\xi)(\xi+1) = \frac{1}{12}\]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^-_{j+1/2}\phi_{j-1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (\xi+ 1)(-\xi)(\xi+1)  = \frac{1}{12} \]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^+_{j-1/2}\phi_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (-\xi)(\xi+1)(\xi+1)  = \frac{1}{12}\]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^-_{j+1/2}\phi_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (\xi+1)(\xi+1)(\xi+1) = \frac{1}{4}\]

So we have

\begin{multline*}
= \frac{1}{12}\bigg(\left(u_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} + u_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} \right) + \left(u_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} + 3u_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2}\right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} - 2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2}+ b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2}  - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)
\end{multline*}

The second term is

\begin{multline*}
\int_{0}^{1} \bigg(\left( h^+_{j+1/2} w^+_{j+1/2} + h^-_{j+3/2} w^-_{j+3/2}\right)\left(u_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} + u_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+3/2} \right) \bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} -  2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2} - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi
\end{multline*}

\begin{multline*}
\int_{0}^{1} \bigg(\left( u_{j+1/2} h^+_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2}w^+_{j+1/2} + u_{j+1/2} h^-_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+1/2}w^-_{j+3/2}\right) \\+ \left( u_{j+3/2} h^+_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+3/2}w^+_{j+1/2} + u_{j+3/2}h^-_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+3/2}w^-_{j+3/2}\right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} -  2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2} - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)\phi_{j +1/2} d \xi
\end{multline*}
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^+_{j+1/2}\phi_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (1-\xi)(1-\xi)(1-\xi) = \frac{1}{4}\]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^-_{j+3/2}\phi_{j+1/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (\xi)(1-\xi)(1-\xi)  = \frac{1}{12} \]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^+_{j+1/2}\phi_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (1-\xi)(\xi)(1-\xi)  = \frac{1}{12}\]
\[\int_{-1}^{0} w^-_{j+3/2}\phi_{j+3/2} \phi_{j+1/2} = \int_{-1}^{0} (\xi)(\xi)(1-\xi) = \frac{1}{12}\]

\begin{multline*}
\frac{1}{12} \bigg(\left( 3u_{j+1/2} h^+_{j+1/2}  + u_{j+1/2} h^-_{j+3/2} +  u_{j+3/2} h^+_{j+1/2}  + u_{j+3/2}h^-_{j+3/2}\right)\bigg)\\\times \big(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} -  2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2} + b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2} - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \big)
\end{multline*}

So

\begin{multline*}
\frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{-1}^{1} u' h' (b'_\xi)^2 \phi_{j +1/2} d \xi = \\
\frac{1}{12\Delta x} 
\bigg\lbrace\bigg(b'_{j-1/2}b'_{j-1/2} - 2b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j-1/2}+ b'_{j+1/2}b'_{j+1/2}  - 2b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+1/2}  +  b'_{j+3/2}b'_{j+3/2} \bigg)\\ \times\bigg( u_{j-1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} + u_{j-1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} + u_{j+1/2}h^+_{j-1/2} + 3u_{j+1/2}h^-_{j+1/2} \\+ 3u_{j+1/2} h^+_{j+1/2}  + u_{j+1/2} h^-_{j+3/2} +  u_{j+3/2} h^+_{j+1/2}  + u_{j+3/2}h^-_{j+3/2} \bigg) \bigg\rbrace
\end{multline*}
