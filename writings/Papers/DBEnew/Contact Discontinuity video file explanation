The mp4 file named Contact Discontinuity demonstrates the release of oscillations from the contact discontinuity as the system evolves. It does this by animating the water height (h) in metres over time in seconds (displayed in the top left corner) over the spatial domain [470m,530m]. However instead of the camera being stationary, it tracks with the contact discontinuity, thus the contact discontinuity appears motionless at 500m as the system evolves.
