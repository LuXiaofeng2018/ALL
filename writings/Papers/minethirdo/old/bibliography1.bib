abstract = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws. These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

abstract = {The author here presents the dynamics of incompressible flow from the viewpoint of the physicist for the benefit of students and others in a variety of disciplines who need to understand fluid motion. The book will be of value to a wide range of readers, including those in the Earth sciences, physicists, engineers, and applied mathematicians. In this new edition much of the material is new or rewritten but the purpose and style of the first edition are retained. Particular emphasis is given to information obtained by experiment and observation, in addition to analysis of the equations of motion, the book's primary concern is to convey fundamental understanding of the behaviour of fluids in motion. Special features include an introductory non-mathematical treatment of three particular flow configurations: extensive consideration of topics of geophysical importance: an unusually detailed coverage of topics of which our knowledge comes primarily from experimental data; numerous photographs to illustrate the phenomena discussed; and a concluding chapter which demonstrates, by descriptions and photographs of a variety of examples, the wide applicability of fluid mechanics. New topics in this second edition include double diffusive convection and modern ideas about dynamical chaos - mainly but not only in relation to transition to turbulence. The discussion of instabilities has been restructured and the treatments of separation and of convection in horizontal layers much extended. Readership: Physicists, geophysicists, meteorologists, oceanographers, engineers, applied mathematicians; at third-year student or beginning postgraduate level.},
