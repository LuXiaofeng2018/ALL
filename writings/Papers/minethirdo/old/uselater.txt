  Fluid modelling is a large and diverse field that captures the behaviour of many very different phenomena. From understanding the inner churning of the stars to the ebb and flow of the oceans at the shoreline. Curiously there is a single equation that handles the fluid parts of these problems; The Navier Stokes equations []. Solving these equations over very large domains is very computationally expensive
