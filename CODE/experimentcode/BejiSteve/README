    Benji 94 Explanation.pdf:

                Description:
                            File that Benji provided along side his data to explain it, I followed the bed definition from this file

    
    Initial and Boundary Conditions.py : 
        
                Description:
                            Python files that has the functions I use to define the initial conditions and calculate boundary conditions.

                Possible Issue:
                            These definitions are very cell centric, for instance I defined the boundary conditions to be at some ghost cell centre
                            and I chose dx so that the cell centres give the proper bed profile and water depth. Also the wave gauges are at cell centres in this set up.
                            Moving to for instance having the boundary conditions at a cell edge might require more thought to make sure the other things line up properly.
